File Descriptions

`question1.py`
Implements a controlled multiplication loop that multiplies consecutive integers starting from 1 until the product exceeds a specified threshold value. The program tracks the multiplier and outputs the final product along with the integer that caused the threshold to be exceeded.


`question2.py`
Defines a function that takes a list of strings and returns a nested dictionary. Each string is used as a key, and its corresponding value stores the string’s length and whether the length is even or odd.


`question3.py`
Defines a function to compute \( x^y \) and applies it safely to a list of `(x, y)` pairs. Pairs with negative exponents are skipped, and valid results are collected and displayed.


`question4.py`
Generates a list of random numbers between 0 and 1, sorts the list, and identifies indices where values are greater than or equal to a randomly generated value `x`. The sorted list, value of `x`, and the first valid index are printed.


`question5.py`
Defines a function that compares the areas of two circles. The function validates inputs, computes circle areas, and returns the percentage of the larger circle’s area that can be covered by the smaller circle, or an appropriate message for invalid input.


`question6.py`
Defines a function that analyzes the distribution of values in a list. It returns a dictionary mapping each unique number to the percentage of list elements that are less than or equal to that number. The dictionary is sorted by key.


`question7.py`
Defines a time conversion function that converts seconds since midnight into hours, minutes, seconds, and an AM/PM indicator. The function returns a formatted string or an error message if the input is invalid.


`question8.py`
Uses the pandas library to create a DataFrame from provided data, computes a new column derived from existing columns, and prints the resulting DataFrame.
